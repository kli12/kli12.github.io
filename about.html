                Currently a senior at the University of Miami double majoring in public relations and anthropology and minoring in marketing, Karen Li is 21 years old on the outside and 5 years old on the inside. If you hear her say "y'all", it's because she was born and raised in Arlington, Texas. She lived there for 14 years of her life until she attended Milton Academy, a college preparatory high school eight miles south of Boston.

                A self-professed beauty addict and freelance makeup artist, she has identified somebody's lipstick down to the brand and exact shade name on more than one occasion...which is either sad or impressive, or maybe both. She's secretly obsessed with miniature things and not-so-secretly obsessed with the Food Network and anything beautiful, cute, tasty or spicy. And though she may or may not love animals more than she loves people, she would still love to chat with you! Feel free to drop her a line via email or follow her on <a href="http://instagram.com/karenthetortuga">Instagram</a>.
